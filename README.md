# Keep Mermaid Arrows

<!-- TODO Plugin presentation -->

## How it works

### Basic idea

<!-- TODO Explain -->

### Files

- `mermaid_data.ts`: Store the necessary data about Mermaid graphs, i.e., what graphs are covered, and the markers and symbols they use that may suffer from duplicated IDs. If the plugin must be updated due to changes done to Mermaid (i.e., changes in the marker IDs), this is most probably this file that must be updated.
